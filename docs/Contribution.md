# Project Contribution

Here you can find all the necessary information for helping you making yourself a ```url-storefront```'s **Project Contributor**.

## Commit messages

The application is configured to follow the [Conventional Commits Convention](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). So in order to be able to commit your changes, make sure your commit messages are properly formatted, otherwise you won't be able to commit. Due to standardized Commit Messages we are able to use tools like *[standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version)* to automatically generate changelogs.

## Releasing

Once you have commited all your changes you can publish a new relase of the project.

Releasing new version can be done by executing ```yarn release``` (alternatively ```npm run release```), which effectively generates the **Changelog.md** file content, updates **package.json** version and adds those changes as a commit (chore(release): x.x.x) to the repository and pushes the changes to the remote.
